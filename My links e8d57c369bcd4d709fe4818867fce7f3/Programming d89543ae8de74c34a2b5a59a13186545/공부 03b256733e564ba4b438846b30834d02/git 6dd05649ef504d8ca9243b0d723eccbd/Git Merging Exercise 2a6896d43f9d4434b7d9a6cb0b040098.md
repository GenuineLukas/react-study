# Git Merging Exercise

### Part 1: Fast Forward Merge

**Your goal is to generate a fast forward merge. Demonstrate that you understand how FF merges work by creating one on your own!**

Make a new branch. Do some work in the repo such that when you merge the new branch into master, it results in a fast forward merge. Merge that branch into master and see if you were right!

### Part 2: Merge Commit (No Conflicts)

Your goal is to generate a merge commit with NO MERGE CONFLICTS.

Create a new branch. Make some changes to the repo such that when you merge the new branch into master, it results in a merge commit. The merge should not result in any conflicts. Merge that branch into master and see if you were right!

### Part 3: Conflicts!

Your goal is to generate merge a conflict!

Create a new branch. Make some changes to the repo such that when you merge the new branch into the master branch, it results in a merge conflict. Merge that branch into master and see if you were right! Resolve the conflict also.
