### Git v. GitHub

**Git**

Git is the version control software that runs locally on your machine. You don’t need to register for an account. You don’t need the internet to use it. You can use Git without ever touching Github.

**Github**

Github is a service that hosts Git repositories in the cloud and makes it easier to collaborate with other people. You do need to sign up for an account to use Github. It’s an online place to share work that is done using Git.

### Installation &Setup

**[install](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)**

Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if you don't already have it, then:

`$ brew install git`

**configuring**

```jsx
git config --global user.name "Lukas Park"
git config --global user.email "nubddak3@gmail.com"
```

### Crashing Terminal

`ls` - listing underlying files/folders

`ls -a` -listing including the hidden ones

`open .` - open the directory I am currently in

```jsx
given that there is a underlying folder called Documents,
**ls Documents
open Documents**
are possible
```

`pwd` - shows my location right now

`clear` - clear what’s showing in gui

`cd` - cd .. (go up one step)

`touch` - create a file

`mkdir` - create a folder

`rm` - delete a file

`rm -rf` - delete a folder(repository)

### The Very Basics of Git Adding & Committing

**repository**

A git “repo” is a workspace which tracks and manages files within a folder.

Anytime we want to use Git with a project, app, etc we need to create a new git repo. We can have as many repo as needed, all with separate histories and contents. so you go into a folder and make the whole thing git repo.

- **Git commands**
    
    `git status` - gives information on the current status of a git repo and its contents.
    
    `git init` - create a new git repo. Before we do anything git-related, we must initialize a repo first.
    
    `git log` - logging the git histories
    

**Adding & Committing**

a commit is one of those checkpoints  we make during projects.

Work on Stuff → Add Changes → Commit 

![Untitled](git%206dd05649ef504d8ca9243b0d723eccbd/Untitled.png)

1. Adding 
    
    `git add file1 file2`
    
    `git add .` - stage all changes at once
    
2. Committing
    
    `git commit -m “my message”`

### Commits in Detail (amend and ignore)

**atomic commits**: when possible, a commit should encompass a single feature, change, or fix. In other words, try to keep each commit focused on a single thing. 

**Amending commits** 

suppose you just made a mistake on the commit. Rather than making a brand new separate commit, you can “redo” the previous commit using the `--amend` option.

`git commit --amend` → this will bring you to the vscode(or whatever the text editor you use) and let you fix and close the file. 

ex)

```
git add text.txt
git commit -m "added two files"
git status (turns out I added only one)
git add text2.txt
git commit --amend (this brings you to the editor)
```

**Ignoring Files** 

We can tell Git which files and directories to ignore in a given repository, using a `.gitignore` file. This is useful for files you know you NEVER want to commit, including:

- Secrets, API keys, credentials, etc.
- Operating System files
- Log files
- Dependencies & packages
1. `.gitignore`
    
    create a file called .gitignore in the root of a repository. Inside the file, we can write patterns to tell Git which files & folders to ignore:
    
    - .DS_Store will ignore files named .DS_Store
    - folderName/ will ignore an entire directory
    - *.log will ignore any files with the .log extension

### Working with Branches

On large projects, we often work in multiple contexts where working with only one branch is almost impossible.

![Untitled](git%206dd05649ef504d8ca9243b0d723eccbd/Untitled%201.png)

**HEAD**

head is simply a pointer that refers to the current “location” in your repository. It points to a particular branch reference. So far, HEAD always points to the latest commit you made on the master branch, but soon we’ll see that we can move around and HEAD will change.

![Untitled](git%206dd05649ef504d8ca9243b0d723eccbd/Untitled%202.png)

(HEAD → master) means we are at master.

`git branch` - viewing existing branches

`git branch <branch-name>` - creating branches. use this to make a new branch based upon the current HEAD

`git switch <branch-name>` - switching active branches

`git checkout <branch-name>` - checkout superficially do the same thing as switch does, but there are a lot more internally.

`git switch -c <branch-name>` - create and switch to the branch

`git branch -d <branch-name>` - deleting a branch

`git branch -D <branch-name>` - force deleting a brach even though it’s not fully merged

`git branch -m <branch-name>` - changing a branch name

### Merging

merging doesn’t mean the deletion of a branch. branches will stay the same, but merging is just a moment when one branch becomes the same as another.

   [설명](https://otzslayer.github.io/git/2021/12/05/git-merge-fast-forward.html)

- fast forward merge(two branches)
    
    if we want to incorporate changes from one branch into another, we can do it using the git merge command. 
    
    - we merge branches, not specific commits
    - we always merge to the current HEAD branch
    1. Switch to the branch you want to merge the changes into
    2. Use the git merge command to merge changes from a specific branch into the current branch.
    
    ```
    
    git switch master
    git merge bugfix
    ```
    
    ![Untitled](git%206dd05649ef504d8ca9243b0d723eccbd/Untitled%203.png)
    
    ![Untitled](git%206dd05649ef504d8ca9243b0d723eccbd/Untitled%204.png)
    
- another merge
    
    ![Untitled](git%206dd05649ef504d8ca9243b0d723eccbd/Untitled%205.png)
    
    ![Untitled](git%206dd05649ef504d8ca9243b0d723eccbd/Untitled%206.png)
    
    **when there is no conflict between the two branches**
    
    just do the git merge <branch name> as the same as we did before. It will automatically merge to the head of the other branch. All you’ve got to do it to provide a message, which will bring you to your code editor.
    
    **when there is a conflict between the branches**
    
    you will see the following message:
    
    Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and commit the result.

### Comparing Changes with Git Diff

**You do this before staging!** so usually when you want to know the change in code before staging.

We can use the git diff command to view changes between commits, branches, files, our working directory, and more.

We often use git diff alongside commands like git status and git log, to get a better picture of a repository and how it has changed over time.

```
**git diff** - show "unstaged" changes.
(use this after saving a file)
```

![Untitled](git%206dd05649ef504d8ca9243b0d723eccbd/Untitled%209.png)

@@-3,4. +3,5 @@ means the git is showing the four lines from the line 3 in file a, while showing 5 lines from the line 3 in file b.

![Untitled](git%206dd05649ef504d8ca9243b0d723eccbd/Untitled%2010.png)

```
**git diff HEAD** - lists all changes in the
working tree since your last commit.
It shows all the differences that are
staged and unstaged since HEAD(last commit).

**git diff --staged
git diff --cached** - will list the changes
between the staging area and our last commit.
"Show me what will be included in my commit 
if I run git commit right now."
(Do this after staging)

**git diff HEAD [filename]
git diff --staged [filename]** - diff-ing 
specific files

**git diff branch1..branch2** - comparing branches.
list the changes between te tips of branch1 and 
branch 2.

**git diff commit1..commit2** - comparing commits
to compare two commits, provide git diff 
with the commit hashes of the commits in question
```

### GitHub the Basics

Github is a hosting platform for git repositories. You can put your own Git repos on Github and access them from anywhere and share them with people around the world. Beyond hosting repos, Github also provides additional collaboration features that are not native to Git (but are super useful). Basically, Github helps people share and collaborate on repos.

### Cloning

oftentimes we want to get a local copy of an existing repository. To do this, we can clone a remote repository hosted on Github or similar websites. All we need is a URL that we can tell Git to clone for use.

```
git clone <remote repo addy>
```

*when you do this, make sure you are not in a git repo.

### SSH remote access

SSH 원격 접속 - private 키와 public 키를 한 쌍으로 묶어서 컴퓨터를 인증하는 방식. 사용자 컴퓨터에서 SSH 키를 생성하면  private 키와 public 키가 만들어진다. SSH type of remote access prevents you from having to sign in every time you access github server.

1. 인증 과정 
    
    -user send and save the public key made in local computer first to Github server.
    
    -사용자 컴에서 깃허브 저장소에 접속하면 사용자 컴퓨터에 있는 private 키와 깃허브 서버에 있는 public 키를 비교한다. 서로 쌍이 맞으면 연결한다.
    
2. SSH 키 생성 및 퍼블릭 키 깃허브에 올리기
    
    ssh key generate -
    
    ```
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "github email"
    ```

### how to push

**option 1: existing repo**

if you already have an existing repo locally that you want to get on Github.

- Create a new repo on Github
- Connect your local repo (add a remote)
- Push up your changes to Github

```
git remote add origin <copied url>
git push -u origin main //for the first time pushing
git push <branch name> //later
```

**option 2: Start from scratch**

if you haven’t begun work on our local repo, you can..

- Create a brand new repo on Github
- Clone it down to your machine
- Do some work locally
- Push up your changes to Github

```
git clone <copied url>
git push -u origin main //for the first time pushing
git push <branch name> //later
```

### Fetching & Pulling

getting GitHub down to our codess~~~~

**Remote Tracking Branches**

“At the time you last communicated with this remote repository, here is where x branch was pointing.”

pattern: **<remote>/<branch>**

- origin/master references the state of the master branch on the remote repo named origin.
- upstream/logoRedesign references the state of the logoRedesign branch on the remote named upstream(a common name)

if you have such a log as indicated right below, you will get the message when type git status:

On branch master

Your branch is ahead of ‘origin/fantasy’ by 2 commits.

![Untitled](git%206dd05649ef504d8ca9243b0d723eccbd/Untitled%2011.png)

![Untitled](git%206dd05649ef504d8ca9243b0d723eccbd/Untitled%2012.png)

when we do `git clone` something that has lots of diverging branches inside it, we run `git branch` and see only one branch: main. However, if we run `git branch -r`, we see other branches too.

`$ git checkout [원격 저장소의 branch 이름]` 아무런 옵션없이 원격 저장소의 branch를 checkout 하면 ‘detached HEAD’ 상태로 소스를 보고 변경 해볼 수도 있지만 변경사항들은 commit, push 할 수 없으며 다른 branch로 checkout하면 사라진다.

to create a new local branch from the remote branch of the same name, just run `git switch <remote-branch-name>` ex) `git switch puppies` makes me a local puppies brand AND sets it up to track the remote branch origin.puppies.

### Fetching

Fetching allows us to download changes from a remote repository, BUT those changes will not be automatically integrated into our working files. It lets you see what others have been working on, without having to merge those changes into your local repo. Think of it as “Please go and get the latest information from GitHub, but don’t screw up my working directory.”

```jsx
git fetch <remote> <branch>
//if not specified,
//<remote> defaults to origin
```

This will only update REMOTE TRACKING BRANCHES ex) main/origin

### Pulling

git pull is another command we can use to retrieve changes from a remote repository. Unlike fetch, pull actually updates our HEAD branch with whatever changes are retrieved from the remote.

“go and download data from GitHub AND immediately update my local repo with those changes” So like 

git pull = git fetch + git merge

```jsx
git pull <remote> <branch>
```

where(what branch) we run this command is where the changes will be merged into. this can result in merge conflicts as well.

**git pull origin master** would fetch the latest information from the origin’s master branch and merge those changes into our current branch.

or you can just `git pull` only if you have switched to the remote branch by creating the local branch also with the same name since there is already a connection configured in between.

### Rebasing

```
git switch feature
git rebase master
```

Git rebase means that it basically re-base one branch’s base to another part.

![Untitled](git%206dd05649ef504d8ca9243b0d723eccbd/Untitled%2013.png)

![Untitled](git%206dd05649ef504d8ca9243b0d723eccbd/Untitled%2014.png)

Git rebase를 하면 파생된 브랜치의 커밋이력이 기준 브랜치와 같아지므로 작업순서대로 커밋 이력이 남게 된다. 나아가 merge를 통해 발생하는 불필요한 병합 커밋을 제거할 수 있다.

파생된 브랜치를 여러 사람이 사용하고 활발하게 커밋이 일어나는 브랜치라고 한다면, Rebase를 하는 것은 위험하다. 왜냐하면 파생된 브랜치에서 이미 새로운 커밋이 발생하고 작업이 기록되고 있는데 이전 기준 브랜치로 base를 변경해버리면 파생브랜치로 작업하고 있던 작업자들의 커밋 히스토리가 변경되어 버리기 때문이다. 

만약 프로젝트가 복잡하지 않은 상태라면 rebase를 사용하는 것을 고려해봐도 좋다.

### Stash

in IntelliJ

`cmd + shift + a` : directs you to action.

type stash → `stash changes`

`cmd + shift + a` : directs you to action.

type git pull → `Pull..`

`cmd + shift + a` : directs you to action.

type unstash changes → `unstash changes`
