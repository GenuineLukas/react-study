### where is a database stored

Dedicated machine 

- host a database on-site

Cloud hosting

- host a database on the cloud
- more popular option
- store, manage and retrieve data
- access data via internet
- low-cost option

### database basics

- primary key field:  contains unique values that cannot be replicated elsewhere in the table.
- foreign key field: a field in one table that connects to the primary key field in the original table.
- keys:
    - candidate key attribute: any attribute that contains a unique value in each row of the table
    - composite key attribute: a key compose of two or more attributes to form a unique value in each new row
    - primary key
    - alternate key: a candidate key not selected as the primary kay
    - foreign key
- big data: complex data that grows exponentially with time.
- NoSQL database: - used to store data in a variety of different formats, ex) document databases, key-value stores, column-oriented databases, and graph databases.
- SQL: language used to interact with databases. A database interprets the SQL instructions with the use of Database Management System or DBMS which is responsible for transforming SQL instructions into a form that’s understood by the underlying database.
    - benefits of SQL
        - covers all areas of database management and administration
        - works with relational database well
        - requires few coding skills to use
        - can run on any hardware or operating system
- CRUD: Create , Read, Update, and Delete data
- tables:
    - is sometimes known as “entity” or “object.”
    - relates to other tables in the same database.
    - is structured as a series of rows and columns.
    
    [Integrity constraints](Databases%2060cee33eb9c244369360c107584d46f8/Integrity%20constraints%207f749a8d0c9348c19340dc6d935d9f43.md)
    
- data types
    
    ![Untitled](Databases%2060cee33eb9c244369360c107584d46f8/Untitled%201.png)
    
    - CHAR: characters of fixed length. the given length of characters is predefined. if you set a maximum length of 50 characters for the username column in SQL with CHAR(50) and the table contains a record for a student with username Mark123 which is a total of seven characters, since the column is defined as CHAR(05), this username occupies the length of 50 characters within the space. again, given char(15), if will take 15 bytes of memory no matter what your string is.
    - VARCHAR: characters of variable length. the given length of characters is variable. You can type VARCHAR(50) to allow any input up to maximum of 50 column field.
        
        
        | CHAR | VARCHAR |
        | --- | --- |
        | - uses static memory allocation
        - fixed length
        - faster | - uses dynamic memory allocation
        - variable length
        - better for storage space
        - slower
        - has an overhead of 2 bytes |
        
        [SMA v. DMA](Databases%2060cee33eb9c244369360c107584d46f8/SMA%20v%20DMA%20efb3b0c1ba364a75a9af9241e1ec7082.md)
        
- database constraints
    - NOT NULL SQL constraints: Ensures data fields never left blank
        - when all fields in the table must contain a value, they cannot be left empty, you can use this  NOT NULL SQL statement.
        
        ```sql
        CREATE TABLE Customer (
        	customer_id int NOT NULL,
        	customer_name varchar(255) NOT NULL,
        );
        ```
        
    - DEFAULT constraints: Sets a default value for a column if no value is specified
        
        ```sql
        CREATE TABLE Player (
        		name varvhar(50) NOT NULL, 
        		city varchar(30) DEFAULT "Barcelona"
        );
        ```

- database normalization: Process for structuring tables that minimizes challenges facing database systems
    - Insert anomaly: Insertion of one record leads to the insertion of several more required data sets.
    - Update anomaly: Updating a record in a table column requires further updates in other columns.
    - Deletion anomaly: Deletion of one record leads to the deletion of several more required data sets.
    - first normal form(1NF): enforces data atomicity and eliminates unnecessary repeating groups of data in database tables.
        
        **data atomicity:** ensuring that there is only one single instance value per column field.
        
    - second normal form(2NF):
        - Rule 1 - Be in 1NF
        - Rule 2 - every non-primary-key attribute is fully functionally dependent on the primary key (partial dependency↔fully functional dependency)
            - partial dependency: occurs when a non-primary key attribute is functionally dependent on part of a **composite** key.
    - third normal form(3NF)
        - Rule 1 - Be in 2NF
        - Rule 2 - Has no transitive functional dependencies
            - transitive dependency: A non-key attribute is functionally dependent on another non-key attribute. A determines B which determines C. A determines C through B.
