# Normal Equation - Alternative to Gradient Descent

### Normal Equation

- only for linear regression
- solve for w, b without iterations

### Disadvantages

- Doesnâ€™t generalize to tother learning algorithms
- Slow when number of features is large(>10,000)

### What you need to know

- Normal equation method may be used in machine learning libraries that implement linear regression
