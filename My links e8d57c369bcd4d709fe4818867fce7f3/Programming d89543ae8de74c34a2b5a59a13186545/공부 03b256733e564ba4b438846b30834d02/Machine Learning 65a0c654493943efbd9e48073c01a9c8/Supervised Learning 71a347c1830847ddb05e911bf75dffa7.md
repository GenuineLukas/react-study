# Supervised Learning

supervised learning algorithms learn to predict input, output, or X to Y mapping.

Supervised Learning - regression: learns to predict numbers out of infinitely many possible numbers.

Supervised Learning - classification: predicts categories. Categories donâ€™t have to be numbers. It could be nonnumeric for example, it can predict whether a picture is that of a cat or a dog.

1. **Classification**:
    - In classification tasks, the goal is to categorize input data into one of several predefined classes or categories.
    - Examples include spam detection (classifying emails as spam or not spam), image recognition (identifying objects in images), sentiment analysis (classifying text as positive, negative, or neutral), and medical diagnosis (predicting whether a patient has a particular disease based on symptoms).
    - Common algorithms for classification include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), and neural networks.
2. **Regression**:
    - In regression tasks, the goal is to predict a continuous numerical value based on input features.
    - Examples include predicting house prices based on features like square footage and number of bedrooms, forecasting stock prices based on historical data, and estimating the fuel efficiency of a car based on its weight and engine size.
    - Common algorithms for regression include linear regression, polynomial regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks
