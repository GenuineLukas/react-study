- Lexical Environment recap
    - The JavaScript engine determines the outer scope based on where the function is defined, not where the function is called.
    - Where the function is called, it cannot affect the process of determining the outer scope at all.
    - The reference to the lexical environment of the currently executing execution context is stored inside the internal slot [[Environment]] of the function object. This reference points to the outer scope.

- a few exceptions
    
    Since all types of functions have their outer scopes, theoretically every function in JavaScript is Closure. Generally though, not every function is closure. Take a look at these examples.

    The function bar() stays active even after function foo() is finished. However, the bar() function doesn't use any identifier from the outer scope. So, when the nested function doesn't use anything from the outer scope, it's not a closure.

    In the code example above, the nested function references something from the outer scope but is not returned by the outer function. This means that the life cycle of the nested function is shorter than that of the outer function, and the nested function cannot be considered as a closure.

    In the code example above, the nested function references something from the outer scope and is returned by the outer function. So we reach to this conclusion
    
    **→ Closure is a nested function whose life cycle is longer than its outer function but is still able to reference identifiers from the outer scope(function).**
